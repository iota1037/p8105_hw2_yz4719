### Description of datasets

The `pols` data has `r nrow(pols)` observations and `r ncol(pols)` variables and tells us about the party affiliation distribution (democrat or republican) for governors and senators for a given year from years `r pols |> pull(year) |> min()` to `r pols |> pull(year) |> max()`. It also tells us whether the sitting president was a democrat or republican. The `snp` data has `r nrow(snp)` observations and `r ncol(snp)` variables, ranging from years `r snp |> pull(year) |> min()` to `r snp |> pull(year) |> max()`. The `unemployment` data has `r nrow(unemployment)` observations and `r ncol(unemployment)` variables ranging from years `r unemployment |> pull(year) |> min()` to `r unemployment |> pull(year) |> max()`. In Januarys in or after 1975 in which a democrat was president, the **average unemployment rate was `r filter(data_538, month == "January", year >= 1975, president == "dem") |> pull(unemployment) |> mean() |> round(2)`**.  The average unemployment rate over the same time period in which a republican was president was `r filter(data_538, month == "January", year >= 1975, president == "gop") |> pull(unemployment) |> mean() |> round(2)`.


## Problem 2

```

```{r trash wheel combind}

  bind_rows(mr_trash_wheel_df,professor_trash_wheel_df,gwynnda_trash_wheel_df) |>
  janitor::clean_names()

trash_wheel_combind_df
```

### Description of datasets

Dataset `mr_trash_wheel_df` contains `r nrow(mr_trash_wheel_df)` observations and `r ncol(mr_trash_wheel_df)` variables including `r colnames(mr_trash_wheel_df)`.

Dataset `professor_trash_wheel_df` contains `r nrow(professor_trash_wheel_df)` observations and `r ncol(professor_trash_wheel_df)` variables including `r colnames(professor_trash_wheel_df)`.

Dataset `gwynnda_trash_wheel_df` contains `r nrow(gwynnda_trash_wheel_df)` observations and `r ncol(gwynnda_trash_wheel_df)` variables including `r colnames(gwynnda_trash_wheel_df)`.

**key variables **
In the combind of all three trash wheels, all the data came from a range of date inbetween year `r range(trash_wheel_combind_df$year)`, and have a average "weight_tons" of `r mean(trash_wheel_combind_df$weight_tons)` and standard deviation `r sd(trash_wheel_combind_df$weight_tons)`. they also have a average "volume_cubic_yards" of `r mean(trash_wheel_combind_df$volume_cubic_yards)` and standard deviation `r sd(trash_wheel_combind_df$volume_cubic_yards)`.

  
The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is `r sum(professor_trash_wheel_df$weight_tons)` tons.

The total number of cigarette butts collected by Gwynnda in July of 2021 is `r sum(subset(gwynnda_trash_wheel_df, month == "July" & year == "2021" )$cigarette_butts)`.

## Problem 3

```{r baseline}
mci_baseline_unfilter = 
  read_csv("data/data_mci/MCI_baseline.csv", skip=1) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(
    sex =
      case_match(
        sex,
        1 ~ "male",
        0 ~ "female"),
    sex = as.factor(sex),
    apoe4 = 
      case_match(
        apoe4,
        1 ~ "carrier",
        0 ~ "noncarrier"),
    apoe4 = as.factor(apoe4)
      )

mci_baseline = 
  read_csv("data/data_mci/MCI_baseline.csv", skip=1) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(
    sex =
      case_match(
        sex,
        1 ~ "male",
        0 ~ "female"),
    sex = as.factor(sex),
    apoe4 = 
      case_match(
        apoe4,
        1 ~ "carrier",
        0 ~ "noncarrier"),
    apoe4 = as.factor(apoe4)
      )|>
  filter((current_age < age_at_onset | age_at_onset == ".")) 
    
view(mci_baseline)

```

### Description of the data

Importing and cleaned the data, then converted sex and apoe4 these 2 variables into meaningful characters.Then remove any participants who do not meet the stated inclusion criteria.

This study recruited `r nrow(mci_baseline_unfilter)` participantsï¼Œ and have `r ncol(mci_baseline)` variables focus on age, sex, years of education, APOE4 gene carrier or not, and age at the onset.

There are `r sum(pull(mci_baseline, age_at_onset) != ".")` participants developed MCI. 

The average baseline age was `r mean(pull(mci_baseline, current_age)) |> round(2)`. 

The proportion of women in the study who are apoe4 carriers is `r mci_baseline |> filter(sex == "female", apoe4 == "carrier") |> nrow()/sum(pull(mci_baseline, sex) == "female") * 100`%.


```{r amyloid}
mci_amyloid = 
  read_csv("data/data_mci/mci_amyloid.csv", skip=1) |> 
  janitor::clean_names() |> 
rename("id" = "study_id" )
  
mci_amyloid_pivot= mci_amyloid|>
  pivot_longer(
    baseline:time_8, 
    names_to = "time",
    values_to = "value"
   ) |>
    arrange(time,id) 
  
view(mci_amyloid)
```
After read the dataset, then use pivot_longer to switch to the long format. The variable `study_id` was renamed to match the mci_baseline dataset.

Dataset "mci_amyloid" has `r ncol(mci_amyloid)` variables: `r colnames(mci_amyloid)` 

```{r}
mci_combined =
  inner_join(mci_baseline, mci_amyloid, by = "id")

only_baseline =
  anti_join(mci_baseline, mci_combined, by = "id")

only_amyloid =
  anti_join(mci_amyloid, mci_combined, by = "id")

mci_combined_pivot =
  inner_join(mci_baseline, mci_amyloid_pivot, by = "id")
```

Here are some participants who only appear in the baseline data but not in the amyloid data, and their id is: `r pull(only_baseline, id)`. Here are some participants who only appear in the amyloid data but not in the  baseline data, and their id is `r pull(only_amyloid, id)`. 


```{r combine_mci}
mci_combined =
  inner_join(mci_baseline, mci_amyloid, by = "id")

view(mci_combined)

write_csv(mci_combined, "mci_combined.csv")
```
Using the inner join function  to join the baseline and amyloid datasets together, so that only participants who appear in both datasets are retained.

The combined dataset has `r nrow(mci_combined)` rows and `r ncol(mci_combined_pivot)` columns, so there are
